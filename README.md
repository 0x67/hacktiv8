# hacktiv8
Personal repo during Hacktiv8 boot camp.

Materials available [here](http://newprep.hacktiv8.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/).

Assignment repo on [here](https://github.com/rmt-05-eindhoven-fox).

To run just type: `node filename.js` in the command line.

Some folder might have `test.js` file, don't worry about those one. It's just prototype for the actual code that I wrote it separate file.

Why updating separate file? Just because so I have backup, in case something went south, plus my working pattern is `today = todayAssignment(if any) + tomorrowAssignment`.
Nah, not really tho, it's mainly just so I have free weekend to play game 🤣
